# Fetal-ECG-Extraction
Stillbirth is a major concern in developing countries till date. This happens due to the fact that pregnant mothers cannot actively monitor the heart rate of their unborn children (Fetal heart rate). The broader goal is to make a wearable device that non invasively, lets a mother get the Fetal ECG and its corresponding Fetal heart rate. This MATLAB program takes in 10 seconds of Maternal Abdominal ECG records from a database chosen from Physionet. The outcome is 10 seconds of accurate, noise free, non invasively extracted Fetal ECG. The modified approaches used at each step led to a laudable accuracy of over 96%.
